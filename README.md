## Languages

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Software Requirements

- Node.js
- NPM

## IDE 

- IDE : [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- Code Style Formatter Extension: [Beautify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify)

- Code Syntax Checker Extension : [Eslint](https://https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) for Vscode plugin.

VS Code uses js-beautify internally, but it lacks the ability to modify the style you wish to use. This extension enables running js-beautify in VS Code, AND honouring any .jsbeautifyrc file in the open file's path tree to load your code styling. Run with F1 Beautify (to beautify a selection) or F1 Beautify file.

## Style Checker and Analyzer 

- Javascript Standard Style is style guide, linter, and formatter for Javascript and styling means ranking the importance of code clarity.
- `npx standard --fix ` is used to fix the the style 

## Code Formatter 

### Prettier 
- Prettier is an opinionated code formatter which will format your code in structured way.
- `npx prettier --write .` to check the errors in code formating
- `npx prettier --check .` to check the errors in code formatting but only checks that files are already formatted, rather than overwriting them.
prettier --write and prettier --check are the most common ways to run Prettier

## Syntax Checker 

### Lint
- Linting is the automated checking of your source code for programmatic and syntax errors.
- `npm run lint` to check the linter to check errors in code formatting in the code.


## Use Case 
* ***Students***: Students and Research grads can take out snippets from text for easy reference later. We as grad students recently found ourselves in a position where we had to reference a lot of text snippets while recognizing reuses in research papers, SimplyClip does wonders for speeding up similar workflows.

* ***Professionals/ Casual Users:***: It’s one issue to fill a repetitive and boring form. It’s an entirely another when we fill multiple of such forms with questions with repeating answers. SimplyClip fits really well in such a case where simple text clips can be saved and reused saving time and effort.


## Troubleshooting
1) If the text doesn't get copied, please make sure that the page has the permission to access and modify the system clipboard.
2) When loading the extension for the first time, reload the pages in order to allow the URLs to prompt for permissions to access the system clipboard.
3) If none of the above steps work, consider reloading the extension and all the browser pages.
4) If the issue still persists, please consider writing us at simplyclipcedev@gmail.com and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
5) You're also free to report a bug in our repository and clearly stating the issue that you're facing. Please make sure to follow the guidelines mentioned in CONTRIBUTING.md
